# bulls-and-cows
A guessing game where you need to correctly guess the secret code.

This little project is a game "Bulls and Cows" from JetBrains Academy. Here I've learned a lot about StringBuilder class, pseudo random number generator and more. The link to the project task is here: https://hyperskill.org/projects/53?track=17

It's a game where you have to guess the correct symbols of a secret code. It is turn based - each turn you get to guess a sequence of different symbols.

For each symbol that's contained within a secret code that you guessed you get a cow regardless of it's position, but if you guessed it's position correctly as well - you get a bull instead of the cow. The goal of the game is to get as much bulls as there are symbols in the secret code.
